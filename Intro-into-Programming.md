# Introduction to Programming and Computer Science
## What is Programming?
**Programming** - The process of preparing an instructional program for a device (Attempting to get a computer to do a simple task _without_ making mistakes.)
Computers are not very smart. They must be explicitly told what to do through **Machine Code**.
* **Machine Code** - A series of 1's and 0's fed and interpreted by the computer.
   * Every instruction is converted into a string of 1's and 0's and interpreted by the computer to carry out a task.

Each language also has an attribute known as "power" or "level".
* Basically, how similar it is to machine code.

Low-level programming languages, like _Assembly_, or _C_ are more similar to machine code, while higher level programming languages aren't.

Each language is unique, in how they operate:
- _Java_ and _Python_ are general purpose languages.
- _HTML_ and _CSS_ are designed for specific tasks, like Web Design.

Power Level varies as well:
- _JavaScript_ is not usually used for big problems.
-  _Java_ and _Python_ are used for bigger problems.


## How do we write Code?
We write code with **IDE's** (Integrated Development Environments).
* A place to write, run and debug code, and also convert it to machine code.
* IDE's are like any other program on your computer except use dfor the facilitation of code.
  * Examples (NetBeans, IntelliJ, Visual-Studios)

IDE's also include: Built in error checking and Auto-Fill.

Programmung languages have a set of rules you must follow, including _grammer_. **Syntax** are rules you must follow (to a tee) in order for the program to run correctly.
* How you type out certain functions...
* What you put at the end of each line of code...
* How you set up certain functions...
Syntax for each programming language is unique.
Breaking programming rules will result in an _error_. **Syntax Errors** specifically returned if the syntax you use is incorrect. (Parts of your code which do not follow the rules.) 

## How do we get Information from Computers?
Programmers keep track of their progress by looking at the **console**, which is a text interface within the computer that us programmers can use for a variety of purposes.

The main use of the console is top output text from the program using code...
* More specifically a **print statement**, which prints text to the console for the programmers to see.
The console is mainlu a Developer Tool.
* It is not usually meant to be used and interacted with by the end user except in very abstract cases, like text-based games, and simple programs.
* It is usually hidden away, and not common to impliment the console in the final product. (So don't try to.)

## What can Computers Do?
**MATH:**
* The computer already knows how to do simple arithmetic.
  * Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
* You can print the result of any math operatin in an IDE that you use.
* Even simple arithmetic math can be very useful in almost any program we wright, and extremly often.

**MODULOUS:**
* Most programming languages have an additional operator known as **modulus**, represented by the "%" sign.
* The modulus allows us to get the remainder of a divisional operation.
  * 10 % 3 - We tell the computer to divide 10 by 3, ignore the _actual_ answer, and give us the reaminder, which is 1.
  * In the case where there is no remainder, the comoputer will return 0.
  * This can be useful when determinnig if a number is even or odd.

**STRINGS:**

**Strings** are another way of saying text. Anything enclosed by quotation marks is denoted as a string.
* Using **concatenation**, we a can add strings together, and even include other data types like integers (and even arithmetic functions) within them.
* If you attempt to do math with a number in quotation marks (like: 4 + "4"), it will return an error. This is because a number within quotation marks is interpreted as a "string" data type, while it is considered an integer (int) data type without them.

## What are Variables?
A **variable** is something that can both store information, and later be refrenced and manipulated.
* Each variable has a _type_, a _name_, and a peace of information stored within it. ("Name", simply being a name for the variable.)

There are many dufferent types of variables, but here are the _primitive type_ variables:
- Intergers - 4
- Booleans - True, False
- Floats - 3.14
- Doubles - 4.0
- Strings - "Hello World"
- Chars - " A "

**Intergers** are variables that can store an integer values. (All whole numbers, but no decimals)
**Booleans** can store a value of either _true_ or _false_. They can only hold these two values. (No other types of information.)
**Floats, Doubles** - Both are types of floating point data types. They can store numbers with decimal places.
* _Float Variables_: Can store up to 32 bits of information.
* _Double Variables_: Can store up to 64 bits of information.
**Strings** store text in a variable. They are useful for displaying trxt and storing **input information**, or information the user puts into our program.
* They can also be useful for outputting readable and formatted information for the user.
**Chars** (also known as Characters) hold one character.
* They are useful when a programmer wants to read a single button press in a string, without using a String variable. (Like a game controlled by keyboard input)
* You can store char's in a string variable, but not strings longer than 1 character in a char variable.

Often times, you will want to keep track of things such as a user's name or score. Variables allow you to refrence previously defined data, and add to or modify it when needed.
* Taking input from the user.
* Making your program have variability, allowing it to change based on different conditions.  

## How do we Manipulate Variables?
When variablaes are defined, the computer creates a little space in memory that stores your variable name and its contents.

**Blank variable names** can be useful when...
* You eventually want to store information in the variable.
* You will use it to store user input.
Trying to reference a blank variable will result in a NullPointerException.

**Dual Pointed Variables** point to the same location of memory that has already been created for the previously defined variable. **Update variables** by setting them equal to a new value.

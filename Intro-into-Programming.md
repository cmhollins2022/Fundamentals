# Introduction to Programming and Computer Science
## What is Programming?
**Programming** - The process of preparing an instructional program for a device (Attempting to get a computer to do a simple task _without_ making mistakes.)
Computers are not very smart. They must be explicitly told what to do through **Machine Code**.
* **Machine Code** - A series of 1's and 0's fed and interpreted by the computer.
   * Every instruction is converted into a string of 1's and 0's and interpreted by the computer to carry out a task.

Each language also has an attribute known as "power" or "level".
* Basically, how similar it is to machine code.

Low-level programming languages, like _Assembly_, or _C_ are more similar to machine code, while higher level programming languages aren't.

Each language is unique, in how they operate:
- _Java_ and _Python_ are general purpose languages.
- _HTML_ and _CSS_ are designed for specific tasks, like Web Design.

Power Level varies as well:
- _JavaScript_ is not usually used for big problems.
-  _Java_ and _Python_ are used for bigger problems.


## How do we write Code?
We write code with **IDE's** (Integrated Development Environments).
* A place to write, run and debug code, and also convert it to machine code.
* IDE's are like any other program on your computer except use dfor the facilitation of code.
  * Examples (NetBeans, IntelliJ, Visual-Studios)

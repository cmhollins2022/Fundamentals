# Introduction to Programming and Computer Science
## What is Programming?
**Programming** - The process of preparing an instructional program for a device (Attempting to get a computer to do a simple task _without_ making mistakes.)
Computers are not very smart. They must be explicitly told what to do through **Machine Code**.
* **Machine Code** - A series of 1's and 0's fed and interpreted by the computer.
   * Every instruction is converted into a string of 1's and 0's and interpreted by the computer to carry out a task.

Each language also has an attribute known as "power" or "level".
* Basically, how similar it is to machine code.

Low-level programming languages, like _Assembly_, or _C_ are more similar to machine code, while higher level programming languages aren't.

Each language is unique, in how they operate:
- _Java_ and _Python_ are general purpose languages.
- _HTML_ and _CSS_ are designed for specific tasks, like Web Design.

Power Level varies as well:
- _JavaScript_ is not usually used for big problems.
-  _Java_ and _Python_ are used for bigger problems.


## How do we write Code?
We write code with **IDE's** (Integrated Development Environments).
* A place to write, run and debug code, and also convert it to machine code.
* IDE's are like any other program on your computer except use dfor the facilitation of code.
  * Examples (NetBeans, IntelliJ, Visual-Studios)

IDE's also include: Built in error checking and Auto-Fill.

Programmung languages have a set of rules you must follow, including _grammer_. **Syntax** are rules you must follow (to a tee) in order for the program to run correctly.
* How you type out certain functions...
* What you put at the end of each line of code...
* How you set up certain functions...
Syntax for each programming language is unique.
Breaking programming rules will result in an _error_. **Syntax Errors** specifically returned if the syntax you use is incorrect. (Parts of your code which do not follow the rules.) 

## How do we get Information from Computers?
Programmers keep track of their progress by looking at the **console**, which is a text interface within the computer that us programmers can use for a variety of purposes.

The main use of the console is top output text from the program using code...
* More specifically a **print statement**, which prints text to the console for the programmers to see.
The console is mainlu a Developer Tool.
* It is not usually meant to be used and interacted with by the end user except in very abstract cases, like text-based games, and simple programs.
* It is usually hidden away, and not common to impliment the console in the final product. (So don't try to.)

## What can Computers Do?
**MATH:**
* The computer already knows how to do simple arithmetic.
  * Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
* You can print the result of any math operatin in an IDE that you use.
* Even simple arithmetic math can be very useful in almost any program we wright, and extremly often.

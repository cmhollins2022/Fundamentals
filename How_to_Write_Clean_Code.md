# Tips on Writing Clean Code
- Easy to _Read_
- Easy to _Understand_
- Not Error Prone _(A small chance of making a bug)_
- Code that leaves you with the feeling of _satisfaction_

### Naming your properties or variables

### Complicated Logic, in very descriptive, self-reading variable

###  Avoid double negative 
(`const isNotBlocked = false` --> `const isBlocked = true`)

### 1) Indentation
Avoid unnecessary indentation, smartly handle conditional code using if statements at the beginning

### 2) Maintain consistency 
throughout the project your are working on, this includes variable names, file names, function names, directory structure, etc, nothing should be randomly done

### 3) Write Self explanatory Code 
Code that can be written for others to easily understand, and in case of complex code/logic, document using the comments properly

# Tips on Writing Clean Code
- Easy to _Read_
- Easy to _Understand_
- Not Error Prone _(A small chance of making a bug)_
- Code that leaves you with the feeling of _satisfaction_

## 1) Avoid unnecessary indentation, smartly handle conditional code using if statements at the beginning

## 2) Maintain consistency throughout the project your are working on, this includes variable names, file names, function names, directory structure, etc, nothing should be randomly done

## 3) Try to write self explanatory code that makes simple sense, and in case of complex code/logic, document using the comments properly

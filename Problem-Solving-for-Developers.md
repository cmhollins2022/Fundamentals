# Problem-Solving for Developers
## 1. Identify
_Problem Statement_ ->
- Start with context.
- Explain why it is an issue.
- Summarize why we should solve the problem.
  - After dedciding the problem should be solved (and worth our time), we can break it down into __smaller problems__.
## 2. Research
_Research and refine the problem._ ->
- Research what others have done to solve the same problems. _(Understand what code does before blindly using it.)_
- Break the main problem down into __sub problems__. _(Do research on tools and API's that can support these requirements.)_
  - Weigh the pros and cons of all alternative approaches.
## 3. Pseudocode
- Focus on __LOGIC__, not syntax. _(Create a step by step outline)(Use functions, loops and othere logic driven tools.)_
## 4. Test
## 5. Implement
## 6. Reflect
## 7. Repeat

# Problem-Solving for Developers
## 1. Identify
_Problem Statement_
- Start with context...
- Explain why it is an issue.
- Summarize why we should solve the problem.
  - After dedciding the problem should be solved (and worth our time), we can break it down into __smaller problems__.
## 2. Research
_Research and refine the problem..._
- Research what others have done to solve the same problems. _(Understand what code does before blindly using it.)_
- Break the main problem down into __sub problems__. _(Do research on tools and API's that can support these requirements.)_
  - Weigh the pros and cons of all alternative approaches.
## 3. Pseudocode
- Focus on __LOGIC__, not syntax. _(Create a __step-by-step__ outline. Use functions, loops and other logic driven tools.)_
- Explore API's and tools before diving into it.
  - Understanding the API will make it much easier to impliment the solution when we get to the code.)
## 4. Test
_Test Driven Development..._
- Write tests, and see where they add value to our code base.
  - Write tests _before_ writing code.
1. __Failing test__ -> Start by writing a failing test. (What you are trying to do.)
3. __Write code that makes it pass__ -> Implement code that makes the test pass. (Figure out how to do it.)
4. __Optimize it__ -> Simplify and optimize code. (Reflect)

- Helps you understand your code _(And catch issues faster than manual debugging)_.
- Prevents regressions.
## 5. Implement
_"Done is better than perfect"_
- Have all the tests pass.
- Have the code work.
  - Solving a big problem is a collection of small steps. _(Trying to perfect each step is not practical and will take too long.)_
  - Get to a __Full Working Prototype__.
## 6. Reflect
- After creatinf a prototype, reflect on what you've done.
- Take a break, and get rest.
- 
## 7. Repeat

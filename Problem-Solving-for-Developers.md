# Problem-Solving for Developers
## 1. Identify
_Problem Statement_ ->
- Start with context.
- Explain why it is an issue.
- Summarize why we should solve the problem.
  - After dedciding the problem should be solved (and worth our time), we can break it down into __smaller problems__.
## 2. Research
_Research and refine the problem._ ->
- Research what others have done to solve the same problems. _(Understand what code does before blindly using it.)_
- Break the main problem down into __sub problems__. _(Do research on tools and API's that can support these requirements.)_
  - Weigh the pros and cons of all alternative approaches.
## 3. Pseudocode
- Focus on __LOGIC__, not syntax. _(Create a __step-by-step__ outline. Use functions, loops and other logic driven tools.)_
- Explore API's and tools before diving into it.
  - Understanding the API will make it much easier to impliment the solution when we get to the code.)
## 4. Test
_Test Driven Development_ ->
- Write tests, and see where they add value to our code base.

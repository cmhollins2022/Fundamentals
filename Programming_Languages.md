_Some of the most popular, currently used Programming languages and what they can be used for. A brief explanation._

_"Choosing your programming just depends on what you want to do..."_

Learn the basics of programming: python

Machine Learning: Python with tenserflow or pytorch. Another language you can use in this domain is Julia

Websites: JavaScript(possibly typescript for more complex projects) , HTML and CSS

Complex Web Apps: Skills mentioned on the websites section +  a front-end framework: React, Vue, Angular or Svelte

Backend and server side stuff: Python django, c# net, java spring, JavaScript node w/ express, Go, PHP laravel or PHP w/ WordPress, ruby on rails or Scala

2d game dev: Pygame for simpler games and for more complex games c# unity or my personal favourite: Godot gdscript

Embedded Systems: C, C++, Rust or Assembly

Compilers: Rust, C++  or ocaml

Kill yourself: Assembly

Data Science: python pandas or R

Automate stuff: python

WebScraping: python selenium or Java selenium

Competitive programming: c++, Java(in cases where performance isn't too important) or python(when you don't care about performance)

Databases: SQL

Ethical hacking: Python, HTML, JavaScript, Assembly and C++

Scientific computations: Python numpy,  matlab or fortran

Be a boomer: COBOL, Basic or Fortran

Be a super boomer: Algo or Machine Code

Functional Programming: Haskel and Lisp

Performance Heavy Web Apps:Any language that compiles into Web assembly. Almost all of them are.Unfortunately python isnt
